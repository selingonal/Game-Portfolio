# Game-Portfolio!
Hello!  
If you're reading this, welcome to my humble portfolio! I appreciate the time you've taken to stop by and check out my stuff :)

Here's a description of the projects in this repository, and how to run them. If you have any questions about these projects(what I did, why I did them, etc.), give me a holler! Please note that I am not able to specify the work I did for Madden21, but I'd be happy to talk about my general contributions (serious business inquiries only).

## Madden 21
Worked for Madden21's Stability, Hardware, Integrations, Efficiency, Logistics, and continuous Development team (SHIELD) to help manage the game's stability, and to protect it from instability by being involved with: 
  - Intra-Madden Integrations
  - New title setup
  - Title Update Release strategies
  - Development/Production Stability
  
I specifically worked a lot on managing the codebase's integrations/development streams, adding new bots and functionalities to our testing protocol, and general testing/debugging.
